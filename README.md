# Hangman UI
Hangman is a word guessing game for entertainment and learning purpose.

You'll have to guess a word of given length chosen randomly. For this you'll get 7 attempts per word. If you guess a character correctly, it will be displayed at respective position in word. But if you guess a wrong character, the person will get closer to hanging by a step. If you exhaust the number of attempts, that person will be hanged.

If you guess whole word correctly, HURREY! 
Don't worry if you were unable to guess and the person gets hanged. You'll be able to find what was the word at the end but try your best for next word.

Happy Playing!
